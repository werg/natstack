/**
 * Contributes the chat panel's commands to the app-level command palette
 * (Cmd/Ctrl+K). Lives inside `<ChatProvider>` so it can read the live delivery
 * state and actions straight from the chat context — the single place that has
 * them — and registers ONE state-aware command set (two `usePaletteCommands`
 * calls in the same panel would clobber each other's registration).
 *
 * The set is state-aware on purpose: the palette only offers what is actually
 * actionable right now (flush only while something is queued/in-flight, cancel
 * only with queued messages, undo only inside the undo window), so the delivery
 * model — the same "now vs. next", "nothing happens invisibly" semantics as the
 * composer — is reachable by keyboard without hunting for the right gesture.
 *
 * (No "retry failed send" command: failed sends restore their draft to the
 * composer rather than leaving a retriable outbox entry — `failedSendMessageIds`
 * is never populated — so offering it would be a no-op.)
