# Authoring an Extension

## Workspace layout

```
workspace/extensions/
└── @workspace-extensions/             # convention: workspace-internal scope
    └── hello/
        ├── package.json               # manifest with natstack.extension
        └── index.ts                   # entry — exports activate(ctx)
```

The directory layout matches `workspace/panels/` and `workspace/workers/`. Each extension is a workspace unit; the build graph discovers it via the `natstack.extension` block in `package.json`.

External extensions clone into the same tree at install time. There is no per-user installed/ directory.

## Manifest

```json
{
  "name": "@workspace-extensions/hello",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "type": "module",
  "private": true,
  "natstack": {
    "displayName": "Hello",
    "entry": "index.ts",
    "sourcemap": true,
    "extension": {
      "activationEvents": ["*"],
      "dependencyMode": "auto"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@workspace/runtime": "workspace:*"
  },
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "problem-dependency": "1.2.3"
    }
  }
}
```

### Required fields

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `name` | Convention: `@workspace-extensions/<short-name>` for workspace-internal extensions. Used as the install key and the argument to `extensions.use(...)`. |
| `type` | Must be `"module"`. Extensions are loaded as ESM. |
| `private` | Must be `true`. Workspace-internal packages are not publishable. |
| `natstack.entry` | Source entry, default `index.ts`. The TypeScript source is what ships — the build produces the bundle. |
| `natstack.sourcemap` | Must be `true` in v1 (inline maps; the build refuses to disable them). |
| `natstack.extension` | Block presence marks the unit as an extension. Must be the only kind-block (no `natstack.worker` or `natstack.panel` alongside it). |
| `natstack.extension.activationEvents` | Only `["*"]` is accepted in v1 (eager activation). Other values fail validation. |

### Dependency overrides

Extensions may declare package-local dependency pins with top-level `overrides`
in their `package.json`. BuildV2 forwards simple string overrides from the
extension and its transitive workspace packages into generated external-deps and
extension-runtime dependency installs. Use this for broken transitive npm
versions, missing registry versions, or urgent security pins.

Overrides are part of the runtime dependency cache key, so changing one creates
a fresh install.

### Optional fields

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `natstack.displayName` | package name | Human-readable name shown in the units panel. |
| `natstack.extension.dependencyMode` | `"auto"` | `"auto"` bundles plain JS deps, externalizes native/WASM ones. `"bundle"` forces bundling. `"external"` forces runtime install + load. |

### Validation

The manifest is validated at three points (`@natstack/shared/extensionManifest`):

1. **Build** — refuse to produce a bundle if the manifest is malformed.
2. **Install** — refuse to record a registry entry before asking the user to approve.
3. **Boot** — refuse to activate a previously-installed extension whose on-disk manifest has drifted.

Validation failures throw `ExtensionManifestError` with a machine-readable `code` (e.g. `MANIFEST_KIND`, `MANIFEST_ACTIVATION`). The error is recorded in `RegistryEntry.lastError` and the extension stays in `error` until the manifest is fixed.

## `activate(ctx)`

```ts
import type { ExtensionContext, Disposable } from "@natstack/extension";

export interface HelloApi {
  greet(name: string): Promise<string>;
}

export async function activate(ctx: ExtensionContext): Promise<HelloApi> {
  ctx.log.info("hello activating", { version: ctx.version });

  // Per-extension scratch — confined to {userData}/extensions/storage/<workspaceId>/<name>/
  await ctx.storage.mkdir("cache");

  // Subscriptions accumulated here are disposed in LIFO order on deactivate.
  ctx.subscriptions.push({
    dispose() { /* cleanup */ },
  });

  return {
    async greet(name) {
      return `hello, ${name}`;
    },
  };
}

// Optional. Called on shutdown / reload. Subscriptions are auto-disposed; use
// this for explicit teardown (closing sockets, flushing buffers, etc).
export async function deactivate(): Promise<void> {}
```

### The API contract

`activate` returns a plain object. The host serves RPC calls by resolving methods at invocation time, not by registering them at activation time:

- A method is callable iff `Object.hasOwn(api, method) && typeof api[method] === "function"`.
- Inherited prototype methods, `then`, `constructor`, `toJSON`, `inspect`, and non-function properties are all skipped.
- Calls to unknown methods return `ENOMETHOD`.
- Method args/return are JSON-serializable. Binary payloads ride a base64 envelope automatically; streams need explicit handling (see the canaries for examples).

Returning `void` is valid — the extension is then fire-and-forget (only useful for side effects, e.g. registering event handlers).

### `ctx.*` surface

Today's surface (mirrors what panels and workers see; will narrow as capabilities migrate):

| Client | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `ctx.name`, `ctx.version` | Extension identity |
| `ctx.storage` | Per-extension scratch directory (path-scoped to the storage root) |
| `ctx.fs` | **Unrestricted** filesystem RPC — for auditable writes |
| `ctx.git` | Git operations through the host's git server |
| `ctx.workspace` | Workspace info (`getInfo`, etc.) |
| `ctx.rpc` | `call(targetId, method, ...args)` for unified RPC targets |
| `ctx.workers` | Userland service/DO discovery (`listServices`, `resolveService`, `resolveDurableObject`) |
| `ctx.credentials` | Stored credentials (OAuth tokens, secrets) |
| `ctx.webhooks` | Webhook ingress (`webhookIngress` service) |
| `ctx.notifications` | `show`/`dismiss` notifications in the shell |
| `ctx.extensions` | Call other extensions (`use`, `on`, `list`, management methods) |
| `ctx.approvals.request(req)` | Prompt the *original panel/worker* (see [APPROVALS.md](APPROVALS.md)) |
| `ctx.invocation.current()` | The current `ExtensionInvocation` envelope, including caller and chained `contextId` when invoked from userland (see [APPROVALS.md](APPROVALS.md)) |
| `ctx.subscriptions` | Push `Disposable`s; auto-disposed LIFO on deactivate |
| `ctx.log` | Structured logger (`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`) |
| `ctx.health` | Self-report operational health (`healthy`/`degraded`/`unhealthy`) |
| `ctx.emit(event, payload)` | Fan-out to `extensions.on(name, event, cb)` subscribers |

### What's *not* on `ctx.*`

- `ctx.panel` — the host panel orchestration service is shell-only; extensions cannot create or close panels in v1.
- `ctx.db` — no general-purpose DB service exists. Use `ctx.workers.resolveDurableObject(...)` plus `ctx.rpc.call(targetId, ...)` for DO-backed storage, or `ctx.storage` for scratch.

If you find yourself wanting either, the right move is usually a new extension behind `ctx.extensions.use(...)`.

### Raw Node

```ts
import * as fs from "node:fs/promises";
import { spawn } from "node:child_process";

export async function activate() {
  // No prompt. The install approval already granted native trust.
  await fs.writeFile("/tmp/extension-cache", "...");
  return { /* api */ };
}
```

Raw Node calls are silent and ambient — the user authorized them once at install. Use `ctx.fs` instead when you want the call to show up in the audit log under the extension's identity, or when you want to ask the original caller for permission per call.

## Health

```ts
ctx.health.healthy();
ctx.health.degraded({ summary: "FCM credentials expired", retryAt: Date.now() + 60_000 });
ctx.health.unhealthy({ summary: "native libvips missing", reasons: ["dlopen failed: ..."] });
```

State is **operational** (is the extension doing its job), separate from **lifecycle** status (is it running). A `running` extension can be `degraded`. The unified-status surface (`workspace.units.list()`) shows both.

`detail` is required for `degraded` and `unhealthy`. `retryAt` (epoch ms), when set, lets the UI render a countdown.

The default state right after `activate()` resolves is `healthy` — you don't need to call `healthy()` explicitly unless you previously downgraded.

## Logs

```ts
ctx.log.info("processed", { count: 12, source: "github" });
ctx.log.warn("retrying", { attempt: 2 });
ctx.log.error("upstream failed", { code: "ETIMEDOUT" });
```

Records flow into the workspace-wide unit-log stream:

```ts
workspace.units.logs("@workspace-extensions/hello", { since: Date.now() - 60_000, level: "warn" });
```

`console.*` is captured too (via stdout/stderr) and lands in the same stream with `source: "stdout"` / `"stderr"`. Prefer `ctx.log` for production records — the structured fields are searchable.

## Crash behavior

Each extension runs in its own forked Node process. Crashes are contained to that process. The manager respawns with exponential backoff: `1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s`. After five attempts in a 60-second window, the extension is marked `error` and won't restart until `extensions.reload(name)` is called explicitly.

If `activate(ctx)` throws, the extension is marked `error` immediately — no respawn. A bad manifest, missing dependency, or assertion in your activation path will land you here. Check `workspace.units.list()` for `lastError`, then push a fix.

## Templates

Four working scaffolds live at `docs/extensions/templates/`. Copy whichever matches your dependency shape and adjust:

| Template | Use when |
|----------|----------|
| `minimal/` | No external dependencies |
| `plain-js-dep/` | Pure-JS npm dependency, safe to bundle |
| `native-wasm/` | Native or WASM dependency — let `dependencyMode: "auto"` externalize it |
| `external-cjs/` | CommonJS dependency that must load from `node_modules` at runtime |
