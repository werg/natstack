# Session Demo Context Template
#
# This template lives inside the panel repo itself, demonstrating
# that context templates can be co-located with the panels that use them.
#
# The templateSpec would be: panels/session-demo
#
# Inheritance chain: panels/session-demo -> contexts/demo -> contexts/default

name: session-demo
description: Context template for the session demo panel
extends: contexts/demo

# Additional structure on top of what contexts/demo provides.
# The panel will have access to:
#   /deps/rpc-example (from contexts/demo)
#   /deps/code-editor (added here)
# Uses nested format - equivalent to "/deps/code-editor": panels/code-editor
structure:
  deps:
    code-editor: panels/code-editor
